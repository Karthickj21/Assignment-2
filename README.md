# Even or Odd Number Checker

## 📋 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
- Displays a simple result: `"The number is even."` or `"The number is odd."`

---

## 🧠 Logic

- Use `int(input(...))` to get a number from the user.
- Use the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 2:
  - If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is even.
  - Otherwise, it is odd.
